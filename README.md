# stromal-interleukin-33-promotes-pancreatic-cancer-growth
This repository includes the code used for data processing and visualization of RNA sequencing data as presented in the manuscript **“Oncogenic KRAS-dependent stromal interleukin-33 directs the pancreatic microenvironment to promote tumor growth”**. Running this R script as uploaded will generate Figures 1B-E, 2H-J, 3A-H, 4B-C, 5C-F, S1A-C, S2D-H, S3C-D, S4A, S4E, S4G, S5B-D, and S6A-D  found in the manuscript. Raw data files for novel datasets generated in this work are available through the NIH Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), accession numbers [GSE269888](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE269888) (scRNAseq), [GSE269182](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE269182) (KC scRNAseq), and [GSE269889](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE269889) (bulk RNAseq). Previously generated datasets analyzed in this work are listed in Supplementary Table S1.
